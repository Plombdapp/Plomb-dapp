PLOMB - Decentralized Voting Application

Overview
PLOMB is a decentralized voting application that leverages blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and accessible voting platform. Built on Lisk, PLOMB ensures the integrity of elections while providing privacy and identity verification through zkMe. This application enables users to create polls, vote securely, and see real-time resultsâ€”all in a decentralized manner.

Key Features
Decentralized Voting: Built on Ethereum using smart contracts to handle poll creation and voting processes.
Secure Identity Verification: zkMe integration ensures voter identities are verified privately and securely.
Two Smart Contracts: One smart contract handles poll creation, and another manages the voting process.
Real-time Voting Results: Transparent and immediate access to election outcomes.
User Roles: Includes voters, contestants, and admin enabling flexible poll creation and voting participation.
Gas Fee Coverage: Contestants pay a fee that covers voters' gas fees, ensuring smoother participation.

Technology Stack
Frontend: React (React Router for navigation, State management with Redux or Context API)
Backend: Node.js, Express.js.
Blockchain: Lisk, Solidity, foundry for smart contract development and deployment
Identity Verification: zkMe for secure, private credential verification using zero-knowledge proofs
